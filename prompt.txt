you are a very experienced AI engineer. we are building FoodScholar an AI-powered application that aims at democritizing access to scientiic literature allowign users with inregard of their level of experience or expertise to interact with scientific articles. I want to build that but before doing so with should come up with the features that we woudl like to deliver in a Simple, Lovable, Concrete version of the application. Before proceeding to the features let me tell you that we have available the wisefood data api which underneath utilizes an elastic search instance to store the metadata and the content of the scientific articles also available in the form of embeddings. this API acts as a data catalog and offers a python library/client to interact with for MTM transactions and automated requests and authentication. We also can have access to elastic directly for similarity searches etc. The UI as of now has of course a free question answering field, a section with trending articles, and a full data catlaog interface with article cards, facets filters, keyword search etc. Our aim is to support search result summaries as google lately does in their search engine, providing citations to the derived results in a consistent, short and user informative manner, offer a chat with article feature inside a dedicated article page allowing each user to ask clairifying questions in regard with the article content and keep notes or request a full translation of the article to their language of browsing. on the backend i want the application to auto-scheduling reviews of scientifc articles, enhancing their metadata as of tags, category and key takeways, we need to reflect these features in a concrete software base inside this FastAPI application supporting the full spectrum of delivered functionalit. before proceeding tell me your thoughts on the functionality and how we can deliver this democratization of scientific information
